## Pull requests

One task, one PR: finish what the task set out to do, then open one PR, so
it goes through review and CI once. No PR per step or round, and no stacks.
A fix to the pipeline (the steward, CI, the machine) lands as soon as it's
ready, and so does a change to these rules that the work needs, in a PR of
its own: reviewers read the default branch's rules, not the PR's.

Open PRs ready for review, never as drafts, and leave them to the steward:
once the review bot finds nothing on your head, every thread is resolved and
CI is green, it merges. Don't merge it yourself. Answer every finding: push
the fix and reply with the commit, or reply with why it's wrong, then
resolve the thread. A PR touching a one-way path (secrets, CODEOWNERS) gets
a judgment first, and lands unless it can't be undone or is the owner's
call.

A red default branch is the steward's to fix, from a branch named
`autoland/red-` and the commit. Don't fix it yourself, in any repo, unless
the pipeline's stuck issue says the steward's jobs gave up; then fix it from
a branch of that name.
